## 📌 The Core Problem

Crypto is driven by **information velocity**.

Signals emerge on:
- Twitter / X  
- News articles  
- Community threads  
- Online ecosystems  

But this information is:
- Fragmented  
- Emotional  
- Unstructured  

Investors struggle to distinguish **durable signals** from temporary hype.

### 👤 For Passive Investors

Many people want exposure to crypto and DeFi but:

- ❌ Do not want to manage wallets  
- ❌ Do not understand liquidity pools  
- ❌ Do not monitor yield changes daily  
- ❌ Prefer to rely on someone they trust  

---

### 🧠 For Crypto-Native Researchers

Many individuals:

- ✅ Research tokens daily  
- ✅ Follow influencers and founders  
- ✅ Understand DeFi mechanics  
- ✅ Aspire to become professional fund managers  

But they lack:

- ❌ Structured research tools  
- ❌ Portfolio management infrastructure  
- ❌ Transparent performance tracking  
- ❌ A credible, verifiable track record

### ⚠️ The Result

Informal investing without:
- Structure

# 🧩 System Architecture

## 🔍 Layer 1: Social Research Agent

DefiBuddies analyzes selected public figures and crypto accounts chosen by the aspiring manager.

### 📡 Data Sources

- Twitter / X  
- Google News & web ecosystem  

### 🧠 Extracted Insights

- Tokens most frequently mentioned  
- Frequency & acceleration of mentions

The system transforms unstructured conversation into **quantified social momentum**.

> ⚠️ This layer does **not** execute trades. It produces structured intelligence only.

## 👤 Layer 2: Human-in-the-Loop Portfolio Allocation

This is the **core** of the system.

The aspiring fund manager:

- Reviews structured social insights  
- Performs independent analysis  
- Selects tokens  
- Determines allocation percentages  
- Defines rebalancing strategy  

DefiBuddies **does not decide capital distribution**.  
It supports research, monitoring, and tracking.

### 🤝 For Friends & Delegators

Participants can:

- Select a risk profile  
- Delegate execution  
- Maintain full transparency  

Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain.

### 📈 Over Time, Managers Build:

- Documented allocation history  
- Risk-adjusted return data  
- Transparent, verifiable performance track record  

This transforms informal investing into **measurable asset management**.

## 💰 Layer 3: DeFi Yield & Pool Research

After token selection, capital deployment must be optimized.

DefiBuddies monitors liquidity pools and lending protocols such as:

- Uniswap  
- Morpho  

### 📊 The Agent Tracks:

- APY fluctuations  
- Yield changes  
- Incentive shifts  
- Relative performance  

Daily updates and alerts inform decisions about:

- Where to allocate liquidity  
- When to rotate capital  
- When to exit positions  

> Execution decisions always remain human.

Crypto has democratized access to markets — but not access to asset management infrastructure.
