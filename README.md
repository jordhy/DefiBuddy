DefiBuddy
Your on-chain co-pilot for social crypto research and delegated DeFi investing

DefiBuddy is an AI-powered agent that converts social crypto signals into structured research and enables aspiring fund managers to allocate capital on behalf of friends while building a transparent, verifiable on-chain track record.

**The Core Problem**

Crypto is driven by information velocity.

Signals emerge on Twitter, in news articles, in threads, and across online communities. But this information is fragmented, emotional, and unstructured. Investors struggle to distinguish a durable signal from temporary hype.


Many people want exposure to crypto and DeFi but:
	•	Do not want to manage wallets
	•	Do not understand liquidity pools
	•	Do not monitor yield changes daily
	•	Prefer to rely on someone they trust

On the other side, many crypto-native individuals:
	•	Research tokens daily
	•	Follow influencers and founders
	•	Understand DeFi mechanics
	•	Aspire to become professional fund managers

But they lack:
	•	Structured research tools
	•	Portfolio management infrastructure
	•	Transparent performance tracking
	•	A way to build a credible track record

The result is informal investing without structure, scalability, or measurable performance history.

**The Solution: DefiBuddy**

DefiBuddy creates infrastructure for amateur crypto fund managers.

It combines structured social research, human-driven portfolio allocation, DeFi execution monitoring, and performance tracking into a single workflow.

**Layer 1: Social Research Agent**

DefiBuddy analyzes selected public figures or specific crypto accounts that the aspiring fund manager chooses to track.

Data sources include:
	•	Twitter / X
	•	The broader Google news and web ecosystem

The agent extracts:
	•	Tokens most frequently mentioned
	•	Frequency and acceleration of mentions
	•	Context and trend direction

It transforms unstructured social conversation into quantified social momentum.

Importantly, this layer does not execute trades. It produces structured intelligence.

**Layer 2: Human-in-the-Loop Portfolio Allocation**

This is the core of the system.

The human-in-the-loop is the aspiring fund manager.

This individual:
	•	Reviews the structured social insights
	•	Performs independent analysis
	•	Selects which tokens to include
	•	Decides allocation percentages
	•	Determines rebalancing strategy

Allocation decisions are made by the aspiring manager. DefiBuddy does not decide capital distribution. It supports research and tracking.

Friends who want exposure:
	•	Select a risk profile
	•	Delegate execution
	•	Maintain transparency

Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded.

Over time, the aspiring manager builds:
	•	A documented allocation history
	•	Risk-adjusted return data
	•	A transparent, verifiable performance track record

This transforms informal investing into measurable asset management.

**Layer 3: DeFi Yield and Pool Research**

After token selection, capital deployment must be optimized.

DefiBuddy monitors liquidity pools and lending protocols such as Uniswap and Morpho.

The agent tracks:
	•	APY fluctuations
	•	Yield changes
	•	Incentive shifts
	•	Relative performance

It provides daily updates and alerts that inform the aspiring manager’s decisions about:
	•	Where to allocate liquidity
	•	When to rotate capital
	•	When to exit positions

Again, execution decisions remain human.

**Investment Profiles**

DefiBuddy supports portfolio construction across predefined risk profiles:

Conservative: stablecoins and lower-volatility yield pools
Balanced: blue-chip tokens with diversified DeFi strategies
Aggressive: emerging tokens and higher-yield opportunities

The aspiring fund manager allocates within each profile, building differentiated strategies and performance histories.

**Architecture Overview**

The system includes:

An AI layer for natural language processing and social signal quantification
A data ingestion layer for Twitter and web sources
A human decision layer for portfolio allocation
A DeFi monitoring layer for pools and yields
A performance tracking layer for on-chain track record building

This is not an automated trading bot.

It is a structured research and portfolio management framework with human accountability at its center.

**Why This Matters**

Crypto has democratized access to markets, but not access to asset management infrastructure.

**DefiBuddy Enables:**

Delegated investing within trusted networks
Structured social alpha extraction
Transparent performance measurement
Track record creation for the next generation of fund managers

It lowers the barrier to entry for emerging managers while increasing discipline and transparency for investors.
